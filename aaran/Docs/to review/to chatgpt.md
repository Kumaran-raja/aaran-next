hi we are doing

Aaran-BMS is an enterprise-level Laravel 12 and Livewire-based business management system with a multi-tenant architecture. It features username-based tenant switching, a custom RBAC system, version tracking, and integration with Tally for data exchange. The project follows a structured approach, with key modules placed inside the Aaran folder out of box app, such as Core/Tenant for multi-tenancy and Core/RBAC for access control. It also includes hybrid service-repository patterns and supports multi-tenant authentication with separate guards.

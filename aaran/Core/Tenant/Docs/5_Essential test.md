## **What Tests Cover**

#### **Tenant Module Structure & Integrity Tests**

1️⃣ **File Existence Test**
- Ensures all required files and methods exist.
- If any file is missing, **lists them in the test failure message**.
- 📌 Test File: tests/Feature/TenantStructureTest.php

2️⃣ **TenantManager Method Test**
- Ensures `TenantManager` has all **critical methods** (`findByDomain`, `createTenant`, `switchDatabase`).
- If a method is missing, it **outputs the missing methods**.

3️⃣ **Tenant Routes Registration Test**
- Checks if **important tenant routes** (e.g., `tenant/dashboard`, `tenant/settings`) exist in Laravel’s routing system.
- If a route is missing, it **displays the missing route names**.

4️⃣ **Middleware Registration Test**
- Ensures `TenantMiddleware` is **registered inside the web middleware group**.
- If middleware is missing, **it explicitly warns about it**.

5️⃣ **Service Provider Registration Test**
- Confirms `TenantServiceProvider` is **loaded in Laravel**.
- If missing, it **shows an error mentioning the missing provider**.


### **Next Steps: Core Functional Tests After Structure Tests**

Once the **Tenant Module Structure Tests** are completed, the next phase focuses on **core functionality** to ensure the multi-tenant system works correctly. Here’s what to test next:

---

### **1️⃣ Tenant Creation Test**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure a new tenant can be created and stored in the database.  
🔹 **Why?** This verifies that the `TenantManager` correctly creates tenants.

---

### **2️⃣ Tenant Retrieval by Domain**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure tenants can be retrieved by domain.  
🔹 **Why?** The system must correctly identify which tenant owns a given request.

---

### **3️⃣ Tenant Database Switching**
🔹 **Purpose:** Verify that when a tenant is identified, the system **switches the database** accordingly.  
🔹 **Why?** Ensures isolation between tenants and prevents data leaks.

---

### **4️⃣ Multi-Tenant Authentication**
🔹 **Purpose:** Verify that a user **can only log in** to their assigned tenant.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents unauthorized cross-tenant access.

---

### **5️⃣ Tenant Middleware Functionality**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure that middleware correctly **detects and applies the tenant context**.  
🔹 **Why?** Requests should be processed only within their designated tenant.

---

### **6️⃣ Tenant Deletion & Cleanup**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure when a tenant is deleted, all related data (e.g., users, settings) is **properly removed** or **archived**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents orphaned records and security risks.

---

### **7️⃣ Performance & Load Testing**
🔹 **Purpose:** Check how the system handles **multiple tenants under high load**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents performance degradation as the number of tenants grows.

### **Next Steps: Advanced Multi-Tenant Tests After Core Functional Tests**

Once the **Core Functional Tests** are implemented, the next phase should focus on **advanced multi-tenant scenarios** to ensure full reliability and scalability. Here’s what comes next:

---

### **1️⃣ Tenant-Specific Authorization & Permissions**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure users **within a tenant** only have access to their assigned roles & permissions.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevent unauthorized actions across tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- A **tenant admin** can manage users **only within their tenant**.
- A **tenant user** cannot access another tenant’s dashboard.

---

### **2️⃣ Tenant Cache Isolation**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure each tenant has its **own cache scope** and does not share data with others.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents incorrect cached data being served across tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Verify that `cache()->get('tenant_setting')` fetches tenant-specific values.
- Ensure `tenant_1.local` does not see cached data from `tenant_2.local`.

---

### **3️⃣ Multi-Tenant Event & Job Queue Handling**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure **queue jobs** and events are processed within the correct tenant context.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents data leakage and processing errors across tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Dispatch a job inside `tenant_1.local` → Verify that it runs **only in tenant_1's DB**.
- Ensure `artisan queue:work` correctly switches tenant context for background jobs.

---

### **4️⃣ Tenant Database Migration & Seeding**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure database migrations and seeders run per-tenant correctly.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents migration failures when adding new tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Run `php artisan migrate --tenant=tenant1` → Check if only **tenant1's** database is modified.
- Run `php artisan tenant:seed` → Verify that default **tenant settings** are seeded properly.

---

### **5️⃣ Tenant Subscription & Billing Logic** *(if applicable)*
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure **subscription-based tenants** are billed correctly and inactive tenants are restricted.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents unpaid tenants from accessing premium features.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Simulate a tenant’s **subscription expiration** → Verify **restricted access**.
- Ensure only **paid tenants** can create new users or access advanced features.

---

### **6️⃣ Tenant API Security & Rate Limiting** *(if API exists)*
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure **each tenant has rate limits & API security measures**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents abuse and data leaks via API.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- `tenant1.api.com/users` should not return data from `tenant2.api.com/users`.
- Apply **rate limits per tenant** and verify throttling is enforced correctly.

---

### **7️⃣ Tenant Switching Performance & Memory Usage**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure that switching between tenants is **fast and memory-efficient**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents performance issues when handling many active tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Simulate **switching between 1000 tenants** → Measure response time.
- Profile memory usage when **rapidly switching tenants**.

### **Final Phase: Deployment-Ready & Regression Testing After Advanced Multi-Tenant Tests**

Once **advanced multi-tenant tests** are implemented, the final phase focuses on **ensuring stability, scalability, and security before deployment**. This involves **regression tests, stress tests, and real-world scenario validation**.

---

### **1️⃣ Regression Testing for Tenant Features**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure all core tenant features still work after changes.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents **breaking changes** when modifying the system.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Re-run **all core functional tests** after adding new features.
- Check if **tenant authentication & middleware still work** after updates.

---

### **2️⃣ Multi-Tenant Data Integrity & Isolation Check**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure no **data leaks** between tenants after multiple operations.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents cross-tenant security risks.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Create **Tenant A** and **Tenant B**, then perform operations on **Tenant A**.
- Ensure **Tenant B's data remains untouched**.

---

### **3️⃣ Security & Penetration Testing**
🔹 **Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities in the multi-tenant architecture.  
🔹 **Why?** Ensures no unauthorized access or data breaches.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- **Check for unauthorized data access** (e.g., bypassing tenant restrictions).
- **Attempt SQL Injection** through tenant parameters.
- **Test session hijacking scenarios** between tenants.

---

### **4️⃣ Multi-Tenant Performance & Load Testing**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure **system stability** under **high tenant load**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents crashes when scaling to hundreds or thousands of tenants.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Simulate **1,000 tenants accessing the system** concurrently.
- Measure **response times for tenant switching & database queries**.

---

### **5️⃣ Backup & Disaster Recovery Testing**
🔹 **Purpose:** Validate backup and restore processes for tenants.  
🔹 **Why?** Ensures data safety in case of system failure.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- **Backup a tenant's database** → Delete data → **Restore backup** and check integrity.
- Test **automatic recovery** when a tenant's database connection fails.

---

### **6️⃣ Deployment & Staging Environment Testing**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure the **deployment process does not break multi-tenancy**.  
🔹 **Why?** Prevents deployment issues in production.  
🔹 **Test Examples:**
- Deploy to a **staging environment** and test tenant features.
- Ensure `php artisan migrate` runs **without affecting active tenants**.

---

### **7️⃣ Final Production Readiness Checklist**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ensure system is **fully tenant-ready** for production.  
🔹 **Why?** Confirms **stability, security, and scalability** before going live.  
✅ **Checklist Includes:**
- ✅ All tests **pass without errors**.
- ✅ No cross-tenant data leaks or security issues.
- ✅ Tenant databases, caching, and queues **work seamlessly**.
- ✅ System can **handle production traffic & scale efficiently**.
